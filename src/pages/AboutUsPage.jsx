                <p className="text-justify">
                  Have you ever felt like you haven't discovered your true
                  passion? Consider yourself fortunate if you have already found
                  it at an early stage in life. It took me 18 years to find the
                  courage to leave my career as a Mechanical Engineer and pursue
                  something different. Indiana Bones was born out of my desire
                  to engage in a pursuit that I genuinely love - dogs and
                  hiking. Although the idea started modestly, it grew into
                  something extraordinary in my mind. As I devoted myself to
                  building the company, my determination only intensified.
                  Indiana Bones was created to address a gap in the market
                  within our "mountainless" region. We strive to provide you and
                  your dogs with the most exceptional experience imaginable.

                <p className="text-justify">
                  Sam Zambon is a mechanical engineer with master's degree in
                  industrial management and master's degree in human resources
                  (leadership and conflict resolution). He moved here from
                  Brazil in 2018. His love for dogs started since his first days
                  of life with a Doberman called Ariane, after her many others
                  came: Nikita (Poodle), Antaris (Husky), Bubby (German
                  Sheppard), Jimmy (Sheepdog) and finally Anya (Shar-pei, above)
                  and Oscar (mix of Lab and Great Pyrenees - top and left).
